The first version of AirPlain: simple, but powerful app for managing your flights.

It displays information about the actual departure/arrival times, terminal data, check-in counters, boarding gates, baggage claim belts, and weather data at the arrival airport.
Flight data allows you to view interesting statistics for all time or broken down by years: total number of flights, time in the air, distance, etc., as well as information about your average flight.
In your profile you can view your achievements, which are given both for visiting countries and for specific flights.
